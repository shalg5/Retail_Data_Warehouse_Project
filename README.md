# Dominick’s Data Warehousing Case Study 📊✨

## Overview

Imagine unlocking nearly a decade of retail insights from one of Chicago's most iconic grocery chains! Dominick’s Finer Foods, renowned for its innovative in-store strategies, partnered with the Chicago Booth School to generate a rich dataset from 1989 to 1994. Our project transforms that treasure trove of over 3,500 UPCs across 100 stores into a dynamic data warehouse, revealing powerful insights on retail margins, customer behavior, and promotional effectiveness. 🚀

## The Business Challenge 🎯

Dominick’s data was originally collected for academic research on shelf management and pricing. With such detailed store-level information – from customer counts and sales transactions to in-depth product and demographic details – the challenge was to harness this data to answer critical business questions:
- Which product categories are the top performers? 🥇
- How do promotions affect customer purchasing patterns? 💸
- What trends can be identified in customer footfall and sales over time? 📈
- How can pricing strategies be optimized based on historical data? 💡

## Our Data Warehousing Solution 🛠️

We engineered a comprehensive data warehousing solution that not only integrates these diverse datasets but also empowers decision-makers with timely, actionable insights. Our approach combines industry-leading methodologies with powerful BI tools to deliver a solution that is both scalable and insightful.

### Our Approach 🔍

- **Dimensional Modeling with Kimball’s Methodology:**  
  Using a star schema design, we created two primary data marts:
  - **Store-Level Sales Data Mart:** Aggregates weekly metrics like customer traffic, sales by department, and promotional performance.
  - **Product-Level Sales Data Mart:** Offers granular insights into individual UPC performance, pricing dynamics, and profitability.

- **Robust ETL Process:**  
  We utilized Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to extract data from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, etc.), perform extensive cleansing and transformation, and load it into our staging and final data mart tables. Surrogate keys and derived attributes ensured consistent, high-quality data integration. ✅

- **Advanced Analytics and Reporting:**  
  Our solution was enhanced with SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to create multidimensional data models for deep-dive analytics. Additionally, we leveraged SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and Tableau to design interactive dashboards and visually compelling reports that communicate insights effectively. 📊💻
